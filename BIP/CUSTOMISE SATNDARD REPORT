Scenario:

https://ehq****************m3.oraclecloud.com/analytics/saw.dll?catalog (we cannot perform customization)
https://******************888.oraclecloud.com/xmlpserver/servlet/home (sow we need /xmlpserver)

1. Customize AR Invoice Print Report
2. Add Payment term description column in data model
3. Add 2 new fields in the report output - term name and term description in the header section of the report

Take aways:

1. Though we can modify report template and data model query, but we cannot validate data using PL/SQL package like EBS system.
2. Fusion SaaS does not provide access to database, so we can't use of fusion database or can't call any database related custom program unit in report trigger.
3. We can't modify or hide the parameters used in standard report.
4. You must provide the values of flexfield. Those are actually lexical references in the report query.
&P_DYNAMIC_FROM_CLAUSE = ,dual
&P_DYNAMIC_WHERE_CLAUSE1 = 1=1 and
&P_DYNAMIC_ORDER_BY_CLAUSE = order by 1

step-by-step process to customize an Oracle Fusion BI Publisher report, simplified and structured so you can follow it easily:

Step 1: Copy the Data Model to Custom Folder

Why: You cannot edit seeded (standard) reports directly.

How:

Go to Reports & Analytics → Browse Catalog.

Find the original report/data model in its module folder.

Copy it to the Custom folder (Custom → Your Module).

Result: You now have a working copy that you can safely modify.

Step 2: Modify the Data Model

Open the copied data model in Custom folder.

You can now:

Add or remove columns/fields

Apply filters or conditions

Modify SQL queries if needed

Save the data model after changes.

Tip: Keep changes minimal initially to avoid breaking the report.

Step 3: Download the Report Template

Click on Layout in the report interface.

If a template exists, download it for editing.

This template is usually in RTF, XSL-FO, or Excel format depending on report type.

Wait until the download completes.

Step 4: Customize the Report Layout

Open the template in the appropriate editor:

RTF → Microsoft Word with BI Publisher plugin

XSL-FO → Text/XML editor

Excel → Excel itself

Make layout changes:

Add/remove columns

Change font, colors, or alignment

Add headers, footers, or additional fields

Step 5: Upload the Customized Template

Go back to BI Publisher → Layout → Upload.

Upload your modified template.

Important: Do not check “Use Default Template” — this ensures your changes are applied.

Save the layout.

Step 6: Test the Customized Report

Run the report from the Custom folder.

Verify:

All columns and fields appear correctly

Formatting matches your customization

Calculations or summaries (if any) are correct

Step 7: Deploy / Install (Optional)

If the report needs to go to another environment:

Create a requirement/request in Oracle for deployment.

Use the downloaded script/source code from your Custom report.

Upload/install it in the target environment.

Result: The customized report is now available in the target environment.

Key Notes

Always work in Custom folder — never change seeded reports.

Download and edit templates carefully.

Test thoroughly before deploying.

Keep a backup of original templates for safety.


-----------------------------
the process to customize an Oracle Fusion BI Publisher report in simple terms. Let me organize it clearly step by step so it’s easier to follow and understand:

Step-by-Step Process for Customizing BI Publisher Reports
1️⃣ Copy the Data Model to Custom Folder

You cannot directly edit seeded reports.

First, copy the original data model from the seeded folder to your Custom folder in BI Publisher.

This ensures that the original report remains untouched.

2️⃣ Navigate to the Custom Data Model

Go to Custom → Your Module / Folder.

Open the copied data model.

Here you can add, remove, or modify columns as per your requirement.

Save the updated data model.

Tip: Always make small changes and test — don’t modify all at once.

3️⃣ Prepare the Template

Click on Layout in the report.

If a template doesn’t exist, you may download the seeded template to use as a starting point.

Wait for the download to complete (you’ll get an .xpt or .rtf file).

4️⃣ Customize the Template

Open the downloaded template in Word (for RTF) or an HTML/XSL editor.

Make your formatting changes:

Add/remove columns

Change fonts, colors, or alignment

Add headers, footers, or additional fields

5️⃣ Upload the Customized Template

After editing, go back to BI Publisher → Layouts → Upload.

Do not check “Use Default Template” — this ensures your customization is applied.

Save the layout.

6️⃣ Test the Report

Run the report in Custom folder to verify your changes.

Make sure all fields, columns, and formatting appear as intended.

7️⃣ Optional: Install Using Source Code

If required, you can use the downloaded script to deploy the report into another environment.

This usually involves:

Creating a requirement/request in Oracle

Uploading the script file

Validating the report runs correctly in the target environment

✅ Key Points to Remember

Never edit seeded reports directly — always work in Custom.

Always download the template first, then edit.

Do not check “Default Template” while uploading, otherwise your changes won’t apply.

Test after every change to ensure the report behaves correctly.
