1. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Purpose: To transfer files from one system to another, often between a remote server (like a cloud source) and your local system.

Use Case:
You receive large files that are too big to send via email.
Example: Monthly financial reports, invoices, or large datasets.

How it works:
You connect to an FTP server using credentials.
Upload or download files securely (SFTP adds encryption).
Analogy: Like a cloud mailbox for large files. Email is limited in size, but FTP handles large files efficiently.


Client IT → generates key pair
   ├─ Private key → stays with client (never shared)
   └─ Public key → uploaded to client SFTP server

 BI Publisher → configure SFTP using:
   ├─ Server, username
   └─ Public key (or password)
Reports → sent automatically to SFTP server
Client → downloads/uses reports from SFTP

2. SoapUI

Purpose: To test APIs (SOAP, REST, GraphQL) and ensure they behave correctly and securely.

Use Case in your example:
Suppose the FTP service is exposed via a web service API. You can’t just assume it works perfectly.

SoapUI lets you test:
Functionality: Does the service return the correct response?

Security: Is the data transfer safe? Can unauthorized access happen?
Error handling: Does it behave correctly under invalid inputs or failures?

Analogy: SoapUI is like a “tester” or “inspector” for the service, making sure it works and is secure before you use it.


Putting it together

FTP = moves the file from cloud to your system.
SoapUI = tests whether the service (like FTP exposed via API) is working correctly and safely.
 FTP handles the file transfer, and SoapUI is used to validate the service handling that transfer, especially if it’s secure or exposed via an API.
