Steps for setting PDF security in an RTF template
Step 1: Open the Advanced Properties in Word
Open your RTF template in Microsoft Word.
Navigate to File > Info > Properties > Advanced Properties.
Click the Custom tab in the properties window. 

Step 2: Add custom security properties
Create the following custom properties to enable PDF security. You can add more properties to define specific restrictions. 
To enable PDF security:
Name: xdo-pdf-security
Type: Text
Value: true 
To set a static password for opening the PDF:
Name: xdo-pdf-open-password
Type: Text
Value: YourStaticPassword (Replace with your desired password) 
To set a dynamic password from XML data:
Name: xdo-pdf-open-password
Type: Text
Value: {XML_TAG_NAME} (Replace {XML_TAG_NAME} with the name of the data element from your report's data model that contains the password). 
To disable printing:
Name: xdo-pdf-no-printing
Type: Text
Value: true
To disable content copying and extraction:
Name: xdo-pdf-no-cceda
Type: Text
Value: true

Step 3: Define encryption level (optional)
For more advanced security, you can set the encryption level for the output PDF. 
Name: xdo-pdf-encryption-level
Type: Text
Value: 2 (A value of 2 typically indicates 128-bit AES encryption, while a higher number may offer stronger encryption. Always verify with Oracle's documentation for the values supported by your specific BI Publisher version). 

Step 4: Save the RTF template
Save your RTF template after defining the custom properties. When the report is run, BI Publisher will read these properties and apply the specified security settings to the PDF output.
