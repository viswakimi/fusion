LANGUAGE

SELECT name,language from ap_terms_tl
WHERE LANGUAGE = :XDO_USER_REPORT_ORACLE_LANG
  AND SOURCE_LANG = :XDO_USER_REPORT_ORACLE_LANG

-------------------------------------
 you want to check which multi-language options are available in your instance, the steps are as you described:

Navigate to Setup & Maintenance:

Go to the Navigator → Setup & Maintenance.

Search for Manage Language:

In the Search box, type “Manage Language”.

Click on Blind Search:

Instead of entering criteria, click Blind Search to fetch all available records.

Review Search Results:

You’ll see the list of languages in your Fusion instance, including:

Language Code (e.g., EN for English, ZH for Chinese)

Language Name (e.g., English, Chinese Simplified)

Language Tag (used for locale formatting and translations)

This is useful to identify which languages your Fusion system supports for multi-language transactions, reports, and user interfaces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


you can enable or assign a language in Oracle Fusion after checking the available languages:

1. Assign a Language to a User

Navigate to Setup and Maintenance → Manage Users.

Search for the user you want to update.

Open the user record.

Look for the Preferred Language field.

Select the language from the dropdown (these are the languages you saw in Manage Language).

Save the changes.
✅ Now, when this user logs in, the UI will appear in the selected language.


2. Enable a Language for Transactions / Reports

Some languages may need to be enabled globally for translations in transactions, reports, or BI Publisher templates:

Navigate to Setup and Maintenance → Manage Languages (same as before).

Click Edit on the language you want to enable.

Make sure the Active checkbox is selected.

Save your changes.



3. Language Tags for Reporting / BI Publisher

The Language Tag you saw (like EN-US, ZH-CN) is used in BI Publisher or OTBI reports to display translated labels.

When creating reports, you can use the language tag to show the report in different languages dynamically.

-----------------------------
step-by-step guide to activate a language (like ZH-CN) in Oracle Fusion so your BI Publisher report can use it:

Step 1: Navigate to Manage Languages

Go to Navigator → Setup & Maintenance.

In the Search box, type “Manage Languages”.

Click Manage Languages from the search results.

Step 2: Search for ZH-CN

Click Blind Search (or just Search without criteria) to list all languages.

Locate the row with Language Code = ZH-CN (Chinese Simplified).

Step 3: Activate the Language

Click the Edit / Pencil icon for ZH-CN.

Check the Active checkbox (or make sure it’s ticked).

Save your changes.

✅ This ensures the language is now available in Fusion for users, reports, and translations.

Step 4: Assign ZH-CN to a User (Optional but Recommended)

Go to Setup & Maintenance → Manage Users.

Search and select the user who will run the report.

In Preferred Language, select ZH-CN.

Save changes.

Now, when this user runs the report, Fusion will try to display all labels in ZH-CN.

Step 5: Test Your Report

Open your BI Publisher report.

Select Language = ZH-CN in the Run Report dialog.

All fields that have translations (via your XLIFF file) should now appear in Chinese.
